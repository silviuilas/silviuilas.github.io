          The team split up the work into several parts to be completed in parallel in order to be more productive and efficient. Each team member was assigned to a specific part based on their skills and interests, and each part had a deadline. A buffer period of one week was included in case of unexpected issues. The team was confident that their approach would help them successfully complete the project.

<p>With the goal of being as productive as possible, we decided to split up the work into several parts that could be done in parallel. This would allow us to make progress on different aspects of the project at the same time, and would help us to complete the project in a timely manner.</p>
<p>For example, we all worked on the architecture and overall design of the application, which was the most important and complex task. This team had a deadline of the end of week 7 to complete their work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert was also assigned to work on the OpenAPI specification, which had a soft deadline of the end of week 8. Marius was tasked with creating a scholarly HTML technical report, also with a soft deadline of the end of week 8. And Silviu was responsible for creating the public blog that you are currently reading, with the same deadline.</p>
<p>To ensure that we had enough time to complete the project, we decided to include a buffer period of one week in case anything unexpected happened. This would give us some extra time to address any issues or challenges that might arise, and to ensure that we were able to complete the project on time.</p>
<p>Overall, our strategy of splitting up the work and working in parallel allowed us to be more productive and efficient, and we were confident that it would help us to complete the project successfully.</p>

                <p class="article-navigation-subtitle">The team spent the next two weeks learning about RDF and SPARQL in order to better understand the problem they were trying to solve. They worked on practical exercises and projects to apply their knowledge and develop the skills needed for their application. These weeks were an important part of their learning process, and they were well-equipped to tackle the next phase of the project with their new knowledge and skills.</p>
