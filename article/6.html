          In our project, we carefully evaluated each team members skills and experience to assign ownership of the apps components. This allowed us to distribute the workload evenly and ensure that each component was being handled by someone with the necessary expertise. We divided the app functionality into three parts: front-end, back-end, and data ingestion, and assigned each team member to a part based on their experience and interests.

<p>The process of assigning the owner of each component is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation of our project. It involves carefully evaluating the skills and experience of each team member, and matching them with the specific components that they are best suited to handle. This not only helps to distribute the workload evenly, but also ensures that each component is being handled by someone who has the knowledge and expertise to work on it effectively. By taking the time to carefully assign ownership of each component, we can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our project, and ensure that it is completed to the highest possible standards.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, we decided to split the app functionality into three parts: front-end, back-end, and data ingestion. Each of these parts is critical to the overall functioning of the app, and we believed that it was important to have dedicated owners for each part.</p>
<p>We assigned each team member to a part based on their previous experience and interests, and the owners are as follows: front-end Robert, back-end Marius, and data ingestion Silviu.</p>
<p>Owning a part of the app does not mean that the owner is 100% responsible for the implementation of that part. Instead, it means that they are the point of contact for that part and that they can make important decisions about it. This allows us to divide the work and responsibilities among the team, and ensures that each part of the app receives the attention and care it needs.</p>
<p>We are confident that this approach will help us to develop a high-quality app that meets the needs of our users and stakeholders. We are excited to work together and to see what we can create.</p>

                <p class="article-navigation-subtitle">After completing the first draft of each of their corresponding tasks, the team members began the process of revising and improving their work. This involved carefully reviewing their deliverables and making any necessary changes to ensure that they met the necessary standards and were consistent with the overall project goals. In order to keep the project on schedule, the team had to be disciplined and focused in their work. This meant that each team member had to stick to the schedule that was outlined in week 6, and make sure that they completed their revisions and improvements in a timely manner.</p>
