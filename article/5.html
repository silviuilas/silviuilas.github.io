          After completing the first draft of each of their corresponding tasks, the team members began the process of revising and improving their work. This involved carefully reviewing their deliverables and making any necessary changes to ensure that they met the necessary standards and were consistent with the overall project goals. In order to keep the project on schedule, the team had to be disciplined and focused in their work. This meant that each team member had to stick to the schedule that was outlined in week 6, and make sure that they completed their revisions and improvements in a timely manner.

<p>After weâ€™ve made a big review for all the components, it was clear that there were a lot of small mistakes and areas for improvement in the deliverables. While some of these mistakes were minor and easily fixable, others required more time and effort to address.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring that all of the deliverables were consistent and aligned with the overall project goals. This meant that we had to carefully review each deliverable and make sure that it met the necessary standards and fit within the broader context of the project.</p>
<p>We began to incorporate more frequent and in-depth reviews into our process, allowing us to catch mistakes early on and make any necessary changes before they became major issues. We also made sure to involve the entire team in these reviews, so that everyone had a chance to provide feedback and contribute to the overall quality of the work.</p>
<p>Overall, these efforts helped to significantly improve the quality of our deliverables and ensured that they were consistent and aligned with the project goals. While there were still some small mistakes and areas for improvement, we were able to address them quickly and effectively, thanks to the new processes and strategies we had put in place.</p>

                <p class="article-navigation-subtitle">In our project, we carefully evaluated each team members skills and experience to assign ownership of the apps components. This allowed us to distribute the workload evenly and ensure that each component was being handled by someone with the necessary expertise. We divided the app functionality into three parts: front-end, back-end, and data ingestion, and assigned each team member to a part based on their experience and interests.</p>
