          The team spent the next two weeks learning about RDF and SPARQL in order to better understand the problem they were trying to solve. They worked on practical exercises and projects to apply their knowledge and develop the skills needed for their application. These weeks were an important part of their learning process, and they were well-equipped to tackle the next phase of the project with their new knowledge and skills.

<p>The next two weeks were dedicated to getting a better understanding of the problem that we were trying to solve. In order to do this, we participated in the course and labs, where we learned about RDF and SPARQL and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>Our goal was to get familiar with these technologies at a high level, so that we could use them effectively in our application. We spent a lot of time learning about the different components of RDF and SPARQL, and how they can be used to represent and query data.</p>
<p>In addition to learning about these technologies, we also spent time working on practical exercises and projects that allowed us to apply what we had learned in a real-world setting. This helped us to better understand the challenges and opportunities that come with using RDF and SPARQL, and to develop the skills and expertise we would need to use them effectively in our application.</p>
<p>Overall, the next two weeks were an important part of our learning process, and we were grateful for the opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the problem we were trying to solve. With our new knowledge and skills, we were well-equipped to tackle the next phase of the project.</p>

                <p class="article-navigation-subtitle">The team split up the work into several parts to be completed in parallel in order to be more productive and efficient. Each team member was assigned to a specific part based on their skills and interests, and each part had a deadline. A buffer period of one week was included in case of unexpected issues. The team was confident that their approach would help them successfully complete the project.</p>

                <p class="article-navigation-subtitle">After completing course and labs, our team had a meeting to discuss which project to pick. We used a point-based system to make an unbiased decision, and ultimately chose the unsplash semantic API (USE) project. We are confident in our skills and ability to contribute to the project and are excited to begin implementing our application.</p>
