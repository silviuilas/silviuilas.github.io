To be more productive, we've tried to split the work evenly into parts that can be done in parallel.
* Architecture + overall design of the application. The most important and complex task. **Deadline EOW (end of week)  7**.
  * Robert
  * Marius
  * Silviu
* OpenAPI specification. **Deadline EOW 8**
  * Robert
* Scholarly HTML technical report. **Deadline EOW 8**
  * Marius
* Public blog (the one you are currently reading :) ). **Deadline EOW 8**
  * Silviu

We decided that we should have a buffer period of one week in case anything happens.
