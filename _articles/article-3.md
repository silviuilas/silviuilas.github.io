We took an initial deep dive into the particularities of the problem we are trying to solve by researching how exactly are these kinds of applications built.

Following a lot of brainstorming sessions, by working backwards, we've established what our application should end up like and decided on the functionalities that we would want to provide.

After we all had a good understanding of what we wanted to achieve, we started to sketch out some data flows and some use cases for our application.

To provide a more progressively granular view of our application, we decided that a C4 architecture would best suit our needs.

This was the most collaborative week so far, characterised by a lot of quick meetings and sending resources back and forth.
